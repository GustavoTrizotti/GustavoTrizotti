## About me
I have always been passionate about the idea of being a sort of "detective", trying to figure out where pieces fit and where they belong.

Personally, I think that programming is similar, trying to use mathematics and electricity to meet human needs, which is awesome. Having the opportunity to work and learn about something that I love is very rewarding. I hope you feel the same.

### • More about me
One of my hobbies is to read. I’m currently reading "Learning Domain-Driven Design: Aligning Software Architecture and Business Strategy" by Vlad Khononov and "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" by Agatha Christie. I also like playing classical guitar!

Besides programming languages, I'm a huge fan of languages in general. I speak Portuguese natively, have advanced English proficiency, and know some Spanish. I’m also learning Greek for fun. I also enjoy geography, trying to memorize 200+ countries and territories (with flags) by location.

### • Programming

Here is a simple rank of programming languages, frameworks and other tools based on my professional experience:

Language or Tools  | Years of Experience
--------- | ------
Javascript & Typescript | 2 years
React & React Native | 2 years
SQL (PostgreSQL and SQLite) | 2 years
Java | 1 year
